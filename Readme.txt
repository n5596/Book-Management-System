This is the project for the course CS 6400 at Georgia Tech (Fall 2019) taken by Dr. Sham Navathe. The project is an introduction to the MySQL database. A book management/shopping application has been created which allows users to find interesting books and buy them.

The goal of the project is to create a meaningful application while improving my understanding of databases.
I have created an application which makes it easier for a user to find ‘interesting’ books. Users are allowed to search for books using different criteria as well as rate them after reading them. If a user finds an interesting book, they can order the book from a bookstore of their choice. . 

Refer to the instructions.docx file to see how to use this application.
